    <p>Based on <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-heal-a-sprained-ankle-fast#exercises">HealthLine.com</a>: </p>
    <p>Here are a few exercises to try when youâ€™re able:

<br>Walk, either with or without crutches.
<br>Trace the alphabet with your toe. This encourages ankle movement in all directions.
<br>Stand on one leg for 25 seconds to one minute to improve strength.
<br>Sit on a chair with the foot of the affected leg flat on the floor. Move your knee from side to side while keeping your foot flat. Do this for two to three minutes.
<br>Stretch your calf by placing your hands flat on a wall and positioning the injured leg behind you. Straighten the leg and hold for 25 seconds. Do this two to four times.</p>
